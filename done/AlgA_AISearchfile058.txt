NOTE = Multi-start Nearest Neighbor Initialization: Execute the nearest neighbor algorithm from multiple different starting points to construct initial solutions, improving the quality and diversity of the initial population.
Elite Selection: Preserve the best individuals in each generation without subjecting them to crossover and mutation, preventing the loss of optimal solutions during evolution.
Top-k Parent Selection: Select the top-ranking individuals as parents based on path length sorting, ensuring crossover occurs between high-quality solutions.
Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX): Exchange gene segments between two parents while maintaining city uniqueness to generate valid offspring paths.
Reverse Mutation: Randomly select and reverse a segment of the path to break out of local optima and increase population diversity.
The parameter values are 'max_it' = 800 and 'pop_size' = 150.
