NOTE = - **ournament Selection**: Randomly select several individuals from the population and choose the one with the best fitness as the parent.
- **Order Crossover (OX)**: Preserve a subsequence from one parent, then fill the remaining positions in the order they appear in the other parent.
- **Swap Mutation**: Exchange the positions of two cities in the path with a certain probability to increase genetic diversity.
- **Fixed Generation Iteration (max_it)**: The algorithm terminates the evolution process after reaching a set maximum number of iterations.
- **Time Limit (55-second termination)**: If the runtime exceeds 55 seconds, the algorithm will terminate early and return the current best solution.
The parameter values are 'max_it' = 800 and 'pop_size' = 200.
RUN-TIME = 4.6 seconds.
